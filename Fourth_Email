Team:

I have finished analyzing our current project datasets. 
Following are my discoveries a possible direction moving forward:
-After running the data against our desired model, we found inconsistencies with formatting and validity. 
Following are next steps to advance to the next stage of the project:
-what is the timeline of the data provided for our users?
-Do we expect any major changes to our structure in the next 6 months?
In order to transition to our new infrastructure model, we anticipate a trial period of 1 month to test our system to ensure reliable scalability for the planned expansion. 
Additionally, to better optimize the new system an estimate of our growth projections would be assist us to better divide our new systems into smaller parts. 
Lastly, access to our previous versions of our data systems would fully allow us to resolve the mentioned issues. 

Kind regards, 
Ali Seif
